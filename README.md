# Health Economics Project 
Excel-based Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) model designed to estimate the financial impact of adopting a new healthcare intervention within a defined healthcare system over a specified time horizon.

# Budget Impact Analysis for Healthcare Intervention
The model follows international good-practice guidelines for BIA and is intended as a learning and demonstration project to strengthen applied skills in health economic modelling, payer-focused evaluation, and transparent model documentation.

## Project Overview 
This BIA model will estimate the expected change in healthcare expenditure following the introduction of a new intervention compared with the current standard of care. Unlike cost-effectiveness models, the focus is on affordability and cash flow rather than ICERs.

It will entail:
- Total and annual budget impact
- Per-patient and population-level costs
- Scenario-based adoption and market uptake

## Model Structure 

Population
- Defined eligible population
- Annual incident and/or prevalent cohorts
- Population growth

Time Horizon
- User-defined (e.g. 3–5 years)
- Annual cycles

Comparators
- Current standard of care
- New intervention(s)

Uptake
- Gradual adoption over time
- Scenario-based uptake assumptions

Costs Included
- Drug acquisition costs
- Administration costs
- Monitoring costs
- Adverse event costs 
- Other healthcare resource use 

Perspective
- Healthcare payer perspective
- No discounting applied

## Model Outputs
- Total annual costs (by scenario)
- Incremental budget impact per year
- Cumulative budget impact over the time horizon
- Cost breakdown by category
- Optional cost per treated patient

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and structure of Budget Impact Analyses
- Translate clinical and epidemiological data into financial projections
- Implement population-based costing in Excel
- Apply market uptake and scenario analysis
- Communicate affordability results to decision-makers
